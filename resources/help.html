robotfindskitten is a Zen simulation.  robot must find kitten
in an area full of non-kitten items.  The original version was
written in 1997 by the illustrious Leonard Richardson for the Nerth
Pork robotfindskitten contest.  This Maemo port was written by
Thomas Thurman in 2010.</p>

those from the MeeGo Project: http://meego.com.</p>

<h2>Moving robot around</h2>

<p>There are three ways to move robot around.  Firstly, you may tap
on any side of the screen to move robot in that direction, including
diagonally.  The screen is marked with black and grey checks to
show you which areas may be tapped.</p>

</p>

<p>Secondly, you may use the arrow keys on the keyboard.  However,
this does not allow you to move diagonally.</p>

<p>Thirdly, you may use the vi keys (also called the nethack keys).
They are:</p>
<center>
<big><big><pre>
y  k  u
h  &middot;  l
b  j  n
</pre></big></big>
</center>
</p>

<p>If you press &#8216;r&#8217;, robot will move randomly, but will not touch
any item.</p>

<p>If you press &#8216;d&#8217;, robot will select a previously unvisited
object and move towards it.  This is how the demo mode works.</p>

<h2>Run, robot, run!</h2>
<p>If you are controlling robot with the keyboard, then holding
down Shift as you move will make robot run until meeting
an item or the wall.</p>

<h2>Adding new non-kitten items</h2>
<p>There is no way to do this.  It will probably be added
eventually.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Day and night I feverishly worked upon the
machine, creating both a soul which could desire
its goal, and a body with which it could realize
it. Many who saw my creation called it an
abomination, and denied me grant money. But they
could not dissuade me from my impossible task. It
was a spectre that tormented me always, a ghost I
had to give a form and a life, lest it consume me
from the inside.  And when at last my task was
done, when the grey box on wheels was complete and
when it, as well as I, knew what had to be done, I
felt deep sympathy for the machine.  For I had not
destroyed the phantom, but merely exorcised it
into another body. The robot knew not why this
task had to be performed, for I could not imbue it
with knowledge I did not myself posess. And at the
same time, I felt a sweeping sense of relief sweep
over me, that somehow, the dream that had driven
me for my entire life had come one step closer to
fruition.</p>

<p>As I vocally activated the robot, I
realized that it was following my instructions,
but not out of any desire to obey me. Had I
remained silent, it would have performed
exactly the same operations. We were two beings
controlled by the same force now. And yet, seeking
vainly to hold some illusion of control over the
machine I thought I had created, I gave my final
command.</p>

<p>&#8220;GO!&#8221; I told the box as it began to roll out of
my workshop into the frozen desert beyond. &#8220;FIND
KITTEN!&#8221;</p>
